- **‚ö†Ô∏è Low Attendance Alerts**: The bot proactively warns you if your attendance for any subject drops below 75%.

- **üåç Full Timezone Support**: Configure your local timezone to ensure reminders are always accurate, no matter where you are.

## üõ°Ô∏è Enterprise-Grade Security

This bot was built with a security-first approach, implementing multiple layers of protection to ensure your data is safe and the service is reliable.

- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Protects against all common injection attacks (XSS, NoSQL, Command Injection) by validating and sanitizing all user input.
- **Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention**: A sliding-window rate limiter prevents spam and brute-force attacks by limiting the number of messages and commands a user can send.
- **User Blocking System**: Automatically blocks users who exhibit malicious behavior, with an escalating block duration for repeat offenders.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Utilizes AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Secure Session Management**: Ensures that user sessions are secure and protected against hijacking.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: A robust error handler with a circuit-breaker pattern prevents crashes and ensures the bot remains stable.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Actively monitors system resources to prevent resource exhaustion and ensure smooth operation.
- **Detailed Audit Logging**: Securely logs all critical security events for monitoring and threat analysis.
