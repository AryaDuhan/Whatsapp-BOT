# üéì WhatsApp Attendance Bot

A secure, intelligent, and reliable WhatsApp bot designed to help students effortlessly track class attendance, receive timely reminders, and stay on top of their academic schedule.

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **ü§ñ Automated Attendance Tracking**: The bot automatically sends a confirmation message after your class ends. Simply reply "yes", "no", "mass bunk", or "holiday" to log your attendance.
- **üîî Smart Reminders**: Never miss a class again. Get a WhatsApp reminder 10 minutes before each scheduled class.
- **üì∏ AI Timetable Parser**: Use the `/image` command to send a screenshot of your timetable, and the bot will use AI to read it and add your classes automatically.
- **üìä Detailed Reports**: Get an instant overview of your attendance for all subjects or dive deep into the statistics for a specific class.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Low Attendance Alerts**: The bot proactively warns you if your attendance for any subject drops below 75%.
- **üí¨ Natural Language Commands**: Add your schedule using simple, human-readable commands (e.g., `/add Math on Monday at 10:00 for 2`).
- **‚úèÔ∏è Interactive Editing**: Easily edit any detail of an existing class‚Äîincluding total classes, attended, and mass bunked‚Äîwith the conversational `/edit` command.
- **üåç Full Timezone Support**: Configure your local timezone to ensure reminders are always accurate, no matter where you are.

## ‚≠ê New Features & Recent Changes

A lot has been added to make the bot more powerful and user-friendly!

- **üìà Attendance Summary Command (`/summary`)**: Get a quick, scannable summary of your attendance for all subjects, including how many classes you can miss or need to attend to maintain a 75% average.
- **‚ûó Breakeven Calculator (`/breakeven`)**: Calculate exactly how many classes you can afford to miss or need to attend for a specific subject to reach a target percentage.
- **üìÖ Daily Schedule Commands (`/monday`, `/tuesday`, etc.)**: Quickly view your schedule for any day of the week.
- **üñºÔ∏è Image Command (`/image`)**: A dedicated command to initiate the AI timetable parsing flow, which now includes a disclaimer about potential inaccuracies.
- **üéâ Holiday Attendance Status**: You can now reply with "holiday" to an attendance confirmation. This will mark the class as a holiday and exclude it from your attendance percentage calculation.
- **Enhanced State Management**: The bot now prevents you from running a new command while another one (like `/edit` or `/image`) is still active, reducing confusion.
- **Refined Message Formatting**: All bot messages have been overhauled to be cleaner, more professional, and easier to read.

## üêû Bug Fixes & Improvements

- **Smarter AI Timetable Parser**: The AI prompt has been significantly improved to better handle complex timetables with merged cells, extraneous text, and varied time formats.
- **Image Parsing Crash Fix**: Resolved a critical bug that caused the bot to crash when receiving an image because the `downloadMedia` function was not accessible.
- **State Management Fixes**: Corrected issues where the bot would lose track of a user's state during multi-step commands.
- **Timezone Recognition**: The bot now correctly interprets common shortcuts like "india" during the registration process.
- **Duplicate Subject Prevention**: The AI parser is now smarter and prevents the creation of duplicate subjects for classes that occur on different days.
